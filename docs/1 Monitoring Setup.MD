1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - **Download and Install Ubuntu**: Ubuntu is widely used in DevOps environments due to its native support for many development tools and systems.
   - **Login to GitHub and Clone the React App**: Use Git to download your React app from your repository, which you intend to monitor.

2. **Setting Up Prometheus:**
   - **Install Prometheus**: Install Prometheus on your Ubuntu system to collect and monitor metrics.
   - **Configure Prometheus**: Ensure Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from your application. This requires setting up a metrics endpoint.

3. **Creating a Metrics Server:**
   - **Set Up an Express Server in the React App Directory**: In the root of your React app, create a `server.js` file that sets up an Express server to expose the `/metrics` endpoint.
   - **Run Prometheus and the Metrics Server**: Start Prometheus and the `server.js` Express server. Prometheus will scrape the metrics exposed by this server.

4. **Setting Up Grafana:**
   - **Install Grafana**: Install Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - **WSL Subsystem Note**: Since you're using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), note that Grafana cannot be started with `systemctl`. Instead, run Grafana directly from the command line.

5. **Running and Configuring Grafana:**
   - **Start Grafana on a Different Port**: If port 3000 is in use (by your React app), start Grafana on another port (e.g., 4000).
   - **Integrate Prometheus with Grafana**: Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
   - **Visualize Metrics**: Create a dashboard in Grafana, query the desired metrics, and visualize them.
